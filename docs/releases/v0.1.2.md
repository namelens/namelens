# NameLens v0.1.2 Release Notes

Release date: 2026-01-11

## Highlights

v0.1.2 is a CI-only fix for release artifact uploads.

### Release Workflow Fix

Added explicit `GITHUB_TOKEN` to all `softprops/action-gh-release@v2` steps in
`.github/workflows/release.yml`. This ensures reliable artifact uploads when
running in new GitHub organizations where automatic token inference may not have
the expected permissions.

## Technical Details

The v0.1.1 release experienced network retry failures during artifact uploads.
Investigation revealed that while `permissions: contents: write` was set at the
workflow level, explicit token passing provides more reliable authentication,
especially for:

- New organizations/repositories with default permission restrictions
- Parallel matrix jobs uploading artifacts concurrently
- Network retry scenarios where auth context needs to be explicit

## Upgrade Notes

No application changes. This release only affects CI/CD behavior.

## Changes from v0.1.1

- `.github/workflows/release.yml`: Add
  `GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` to all four
  `softprops/action-gh-release@v2` steps
