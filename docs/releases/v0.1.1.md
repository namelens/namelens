# NameLens v0.1.1 Release Notes

Release date: 2026-01-07

## Highlights

v0.1.1 focuses on rate-limit tooling and improved stability for high-throughput batch runs.

- **Rate limit admin commands**: New `namelens rate-limit list` and `namelens rate-limit reset` commands to inspect and clear persisted rate limit state without manual database access.
- **SQLite concurrency fix**: Batch checks no longer fail with "database is locked" errors thanks to WAL mode, busy timeout, and single-connection serialization for local libsql stores.
- **CI update**: macOS runner updated from retired macos-13 to macos-15-intel.

## Rate Limit Commands

```bash
# List all stored rate limits
namelens rate-limit list

# List endpoints matching a prefix
namelens rate-limit list --prefix=rdap.

# Reset all rate limits (requires confirmation)
namelens rate-limit reset --all --yes

# Reset a specific endpoint
namelens rate-limit reset --endpoint=rdap.verisign.com

# Dry run to see what would be deleted
namelens rate-limit reset --all --dry-run

# JSON output for automation
namelens rate-limit list --output=json
```

## Notes

- If you see `rate limited` results in batch output, NameLens is applying endpoint backoff to avoid hammering providers.
- For local stores (`file:` libsql/SQLite), WAL mode is enabled to reduce lock contention during concurrent checks.
